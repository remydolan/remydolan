- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Remy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as possible about anything to do with Maths, Computing and Physics!
- ðŸŒ± I recently finished my Masters in Applied Computing, I spent the summer training an AI to detect craters on the surface of the Moon!
- Once I have time I'll be creating a new repo for my undergraduate dissertation where I created a really accurate Python program for integrating differential equations, (I used Runge-Kutta Fehlberg), as well as attempting some mini projects which include writing my own small facial recogonition system using PCA/LDA and  calculating someone's heart rate using frames of their face (using Python/C++ instead of Mathematica).
- I will also soon be adding some programs which can be used for National 5 to Advanced Higher Physics and Maths.
- Additionally, I have a repo where I will put my solutions to some Advent of Code problems I enjoyed!
