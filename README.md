- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Remy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as possible about anything to do with Maths, Computing and Physics!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for my Masters in Applied Computing, I'm spending the summer training an AI to detect craters on the surface of the Moon in order for a spacecraft to land safely! Once that is done I will be making my dissertation repo public.
- Once I have time I'll be creating new repos for my undergraduate dissertation where I created a really accurate Python program for integrating differential equations, (I used Runge-Kutta Fehlberg), as well as mini projects which include deploying a facial recognition AI to a Raspberry Pi, calculating someone's heart rate using frames of their face, and other smaller Arduino projects.
